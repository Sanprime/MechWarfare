This is a setup guide for the mjpg streamer. Currently, this guide is optimized for using the raspberry pi camera with the mjpg streamer.

NOTE: It is possible to use usb webcams with the streamer, but I found that the performance overhead is much higher than with using the raspberry pi camera (which I recommend)

For reference information, check out the git repo: 

1) Be sure that cmake is installed on the raspberry pi. It is necessary for setting up the mjpg streamer.

2) Go into the mjpg-streamer-experimental directory, and run the command "cmake ." (no quotes). This will generate makefiles so you can compile it.

3) run "make". This should compile all modules of the mjpg streamer.

RUNNING THE STREAMER########

1) There should be a streamStart.sh script that I provide that should start the script. Run it to start the streamer.
   -Quickstart.sh is a separate script that I also provided. It is the settings I used for a logitech C270 webcam. It does not perform as well as the picam.

2) I leave it as an exercise to the reader to setup the raspberry pi to run the script as soon as it starts up. I would suggest researching crontabs (specifically the @reboot directive). This can also be used to start up the mech control as well.
